# Introduction

<https://purrr.tidyverse.org/>:

> purrr enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a
> complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and
> vectors. If you’ve never heard of FP before, the best place to start
> is the family of map() functions which allow you to replace many for
> loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read. The
> best place to learn about the map() functions is the iteration chapter
> in R for Data Science.

See the
[cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/purrr.pdf)
for a quick overview of the capabilities of {purrr}.

## Iteration

> [In this chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration), you’ll learn
> tools for iteration, repeatedly performing the same action on
> different objects. Iteration in R generally tends to look rather
> different from other programming languages because so much of it is
> implicit and we get it for free. For example, if you want to double a
> numeric vector x in R, you can just write 2 \* x. In most other
> languages, you’d need to explicitly double each element of x using
> some sort of for loop.
