# Introduction

This [R package
workshop](https://combine-australia.github.io/r-pkg-dev/) was created by
COMBINE, an association for Australian students in bioinformatics,
computational biology, and related fields. It is licensed under a

An R package is a collection of functions that are bundled together in a
way that makes it easy to share. Usually these functions are designed to
work together to complete a specific task such as analysing a particular
kind of data. Packages are the best way to distribute code and
documentation; even if you never intend to share your package it is
useful to have a place to store your commonly used functions. Itâ€™s a bit
more effort now but it will save you a lot of time in the long run.

This workshop teaches a modern package development workflow that makes
use of packages designed to help with writing packages. The two main
packages are {devtools} and {usethis}:

- {devtools} contains functions that will help with development tasks
  such as checking, building and installing packages.
- {usethis} contains a range of templates and handy functions for making
  life easier, many of which were originally in {devtools}.

Other packages used in this workshop include:

- {roxygen2} for function documentation
- {testthat} for writing unit tests
- {knitr} for building vignettes

Install the required packages for this workshop.

``` r
pkgs <- c("devtools", "usethis", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr", "ggplot2", "rlang")
install.packages(pkgs, Ncpus = 2)
```

Some stages of the package development process can require other
programs to be installed on your computer. To check that you have
everything you need run the following:

``` r
pkgbuild::check_build_tools()
```

    Your system is ready to build packages!
